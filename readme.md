# SourceMap out of alignment when referencing external modules

This is a demo of how defining external modules affects sourcemaps generated by Webpack.

## Testing environment:

- Chrome v58.0.3029.81
- MS Windows 10 Pro 14393.1066
- Chrome debugger cache disabled (debugger network tab  > Disable cache checked)

## Installation

1. `npm install` to install the dependencies (webpack and webpack-dev-server)
2. `npm run serve` to start webpack-dev-server

### Test Webpack config with no externals defined

1. Open http://localhost:8080/good.html in Chrome
2. Open Debugger (F12)
3. Refresh (F5)
4. Debugger will stop at `debugger;` (expected behaviour).

### Test Webpack config with externals defined

1. Open http://localhost:8080/bad.html in Chrome
2. Open Debugger (F12)
3. Refresh (F5)
4. Debugger is one line out of alignment (unexpected behaviour).
